         <p>
          Harvesting trees in forestry operations takes a lot of planning and preparation. Harvest design, felling and bucking methods, skidding methods, and disposal of debris and litter should be planned and accounted for.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Harvest design includes determing appropriate locations for tree landings, minimizing distrubance to soil and native vegetation, and determing appropriate trees to harvest.
          </li>
          <li>
           Felling is the process of determining the best strategy for cutting down a tree and bucking is cutting the tree into manageable sections.
          </li>
          <li>
           Skidding is the process of moving the timber from the harvest site to a processing or transportation site.
          </li>
         </ul>

           Harvest Design
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Landings should be located to reduce the impact of
    skidding on the natural water drainage pattern. Skidding
    should avoid road ditches,  culverts, sensitive sites,
    excessive slopes, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
           Landings should be located on firm ground outside of the
    SMZ so runoff is well dispersed before reaching the SMZ
          </li>
          <li>
           When operations are complete,  plan to disperse water
    runoff from  landings and  secondary roads by
    implementing  BMPs where the potential for increased
    erosion exists.
          </li>
          <li>
           Activities located adjacent to navigable waters must
    comply with applicable U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
    regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
           Shading,  soil stabilization, and the water filtering effects
    of vegetation should be provided along  streams by using
    one or more of the following methods: 1.) Leave trees, shrubs, grasses, rocks, and
  naturally felled timber wherever they provide
  shade over a  stream or stabilize the  soil near
  such a stream.  2.) Harvest timber from the  SMZ in such a way
  that shading and filtering effects are
  maintained. 3.) Where it is difficult to leave adequate
  vegetation within the  SMZ to provide  stream
  protection, cover should be re-established as
  soon as possible after harvesting is complete
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Felling and Bucking
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Minimize soil disturbance and protect the residual timber
    stand within the SMZ.
          </li>
          <li>
           If possible, trees harvested in the SMZ should be removed
    from the SMZ prior to skidding.
          </li>
          <li>
           Directional  felling should be used near  streams to
    minimize debris entering the stream. Any tree that cannot
    be felled without falling into or across the streambed
    should be left standing. Trees accidentally felled across
    streams should be topped prior to skidding or removed by
    the top from the other side.
          </li>
          <li>
           Minimize the number of trees harvested on the  stream
    bank within an  SMZ where they may help to protect the
    integrity of the  stream, provide shade, and stabilize the
    bank.
          </li>
          <li>
           Trees should be removed from the  SMZ before being
    limbed and topped if the adjacent areas are to be burned
    after logging operations.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Skidding
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Skid trails should be placed to minimize disruption of
    natural drainage patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
           Stream channels, road ditches, or roads (primary or
    secondary) should not be used as skid trails.
          </li>
          <li>
           Temporary crossings using  culverts, poles, or portable
    bridges should be removed and the site restored as soon as
    their use is complete.  Dirt crossings and  fords should
    never be used.
          </li>
          <li>
           Skid trails on  slopes should have occasional breaks in
    grade to vent water. Upon completion of use, and if
    necessary, trails should be stabilized to prevent excessive
    soil erosion.
          </li>
          <li>
           Erosion prone areas should be mulched, seeded, stabilized
    with  logging debris to help re-establish permanent
    vegetative cover when necessary.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Disposal of debris and litter
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Logging debris in  streams should be removed
    immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
           Logging debris should not be pushed into drains, streams,
    or SMZs.
          </li>
          <li>
           All trash associated with the logging operation should be
    promptly hauled to a legal disposal site (not buried).
          </li>
          <li>
           All equipment fluids should be captured and disposed of
    properly. Service equipment  away from  streams outside
    the  SMZ so accidental spillage will not result in  stream
    contamination.
          </li>
