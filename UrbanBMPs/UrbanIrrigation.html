          <strong>
           Irrigation audits and monitoring
          </strong>
          : determines the amount of water necessary to support landscaped vegetation and the appropriate water irrigation system. Irritation audits can also be used to determine the amount of water being consumed for landscaping to monitor for  leaks or identify areas to improve, replace, or upgrade to more efficient equipment.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Replacing water intensive vegetation with regionally appropriate native vegetation
          </strong>
          : this BMP is one of the most effective ways residential or commercial properties can become more efficient with water use. Replacing water intensive, exotic or non-native species with regionally appropriate species can greatly reduce the water needed for landscaping. Native plants typically need less water because they are adapted to regional rainfall and also typically need less maintenance.

         <p>
          <strong>
           Micro irrigation
          </strong>
          : utilizes a system of small tubing or pipes to irrigate plants or landscaping on the surface and close to  plant roots. Micro irrigation reduces the amount of water lost through evaporation or conveyance and offers greater contol over the amount of water used than traditional sprinkler systems. This irrigation systems will also reduce weed growth by limiting the application of water in the landscape.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Drip irrigation
          </strong>
          : also utilizes a system of small tubing or pipes but instead of releasing water directly near a plant, the tubing has small holes at regular inverals along the tubing to water greater surface areas. This type of irrigation is more suited for shubs or trees with extensive root systems.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Soil soaker systems:
          </strong>
          are similar in function to drip irrigation systems but instead of having openings at regular intervals, soaker systems are made of porous materials to allow the slow seepage of water out of the tubing.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Installing timers for sprinkler and irrigation systems and more efficient sprinklers
          </strong>
          : this allows for more efficient timing of irrigation (like early morning instead of the middle of the day) and controls the amount of water applied. Replacing traditional sprinkler systems with micro, drip, or soaker systems reduces the amount of water needed to maintain landscaping and reduces soil and chemical runoff from the property.
