<h1>Best Management Practices (BMP) by Conservation Objective</h1>
<p>BMPs are stewardship practices to help landowners restore and improve degraded land conditions associated with Ecological Site Descriptions. The links provided originate from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Best Management Practices for the Conservation of Texas Aquatic Ecosystems website. This website was developed in 201x and has been periodically updated during the interim. While extensive, the website is not exhaustive, so landowners are encouraged to further research selected BMPs either online, via workshops, or through the local Natural Resources Conservation Service office.</p>

</ul>
<h3><u>Revegetation and Erosion Control</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/ConstructionBMPs/CheckDams.html">Check Dams</a> – small dams constructed of rock or straw to slow runoff and capture sediment in upland drainage areas with high runoff velocities. </li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/ErosionBlanket.html">Erosion Control Blankets and Mulches</a> - mulching and erosion control blankets are ground cover techniques used primarily to prevent surface soil erosion.</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/Barriers.html">Sediment Barriers</a> (barriers, berms, fences)-used primarily as structures to slow stormwater runoff into streams, filter sediment and promote stormwater infiltration.</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Protection of Riparian Areas and Floodplains</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/DesignatedTrails.html">Designated Trails and Access Points</a> - limiting access to riparian zones through trails and walkways helps protect riparian zones and maintain bank stability.</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/RiparianBufferZone.html">Designing or Restoring a Riparian Buffer Zone</a> (aka Develop or protect a riparian buffer zone) - a riparian buffer zone is a designated and protected section of vegetation and habitat along streams, creeks, lakes, and wetlands.</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/FencingRiparianAreas.html">Fencing Riparian Areas and Livestock Exclusion</a> - temporary or permanent fencing is an effective BMP to protect riparian and stream habitats.</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/AlternateShade.html">Alternate Shade Sources</a> - Natural, portable or permanent structures for ranches practicing riparian fencing and livestock exclusion</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/AlternateWaterFood.html">Alternate Water Sources and Supplemental Feed for Livestock</a> - off-stream watering areas for livestock offers protection to riparian areas</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/CuttingsTransplants.html">Cuttings, transplants, and seeding</a> - cuttings are stem or root sections taken from a source plant for the purpose of propagating a new plant</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/GrazingControl.html">Grazing control in riparian areas</a> - is necessary to protect stream banks from erosion, vegetation from being overgrazed, and prevent excessive nutrient inputs from livestock.</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/AgBMPs/IrrigationManagement.html">Irrigation Management</a> - can conserve substantial amounts of water, increase farm and ranch production and profit, and prevent damage to the land through erosion and nutrient runoff</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/InstreamHabitatBMPs/WoodyDebris.html">Large Woody Debris</a> - typically comes from trees that have fallen over or been washed into streams. It provides shelter and instream habitat for fish and aquatic organisms, provides organic material into stream food webs, and can help stabilize eroding banks by collecting sediment.</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/Fragmentation.html">Prevention of Riparian Habitat Fragmentation</a> - riparian habitat fragmentation can result in decreased species diversity, disrupted wildlife and bird migration and reproduction, limited food sources, and decreased woody debris input to streams for fish habitat.</li>
<li><a href="https://tsmcgrath.github.io/catchBMP/RiparianBMPs/NativeSpecies.html">Protection or Revegetation of Native Species</a> - native species protection or restoration is imperative in maintaining healthy and functioning watersheds</li>
